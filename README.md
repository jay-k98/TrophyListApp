# TrophyListApp

## First app
This is the first app I ever built. It is a university project where the only requirement was: "The app must contain a list, where items can be added and removed"

## Use case
It enables users to organize Playstation trophies and get statistics like total time played etc. The app also tracks your level according to the *old* levelling system. This is because the app was built in 2019 and shortly after, Sony decided to change the leveling system. Read more about the leveling system changes on the official [Playstation Blog](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/07/upcoming-trophy-levelling-changes-detailed/). Ps: Please don't tell anyone that I still prefer the old level system.
